# Club Alterations — Website

A lightweight static website for Club Alterations, an independent clubhouse in Pasadena, Texas that provides meeting space for independent Alcoholics Anonymous groups. The site is intentionally written to distinguish the clubhouse from A.A. as an organization and to protect member anonymity.

## Site goals

- Make today's meetings immediately visible.
- Keep navigation simple for a non-technical audience.
- Make directions, parking, and entrance details unusually clear.
- Separate events at the club from events elsewhere in the fellowship.
- Use a restrained, community-oriented visual style instead of generic recovery imagery.
- Provide prominent links to A.A. and related resources.
- Work well on older/smaller phones.

## Run locally

No build step is required.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

You can also open `index.html` directly in a browser.

## Structure

- `index.html` — page structure/content
- `styles.css` — responsive layout and visual design
- `script.js` — demo meeting data and day filtering

## Before publishing

Verify all public club information in `site-data.js`, especially the phone number, email address, meeting schedule, accessibility information, event details, and address. Do not publish member/chair names or other personally identifying information in meeting data.

The SEO files currently use `https://clubalterations-ptx.org/` as the public site URL because the configured contact email uses that domain. If the actual public URL differs, update it in `index.html`, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` before publishing.

The footer states that Club Alterations is an independent clubhouse and is not operated by or affiliated with Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. The club should approve its final organizational language.

## Editing site information

Routine site information lives in **`site-data.js`**. This is the first file to edit when the club's information changes.

For example, the address is defined once:

```js
address: {
  street: "123 Example Street",
  city: "San Antonio",
  state: "TX",
  postalCode: "78xxx"
}
```

Changing those four values automatically updates every displayed club address as well as the Google Maps and Apple Maps links.

The same applies to the phone number, email address, entrance information, parking information, accessibility note, club name/tagline, and meeting schedule.

### Files

- `site-data.js` — **routine editable content and meeting data**
- `index.html` — page structure; normally does not need editing for routine information changes
- `styles.css` — visual design and responsive layout
- `script.js` — rendering/binding logic; normally does not need editing for routine information changes

## SEO and search setup

The site includes:

- descriptive page title and meta description
- canonical URL
- Open Graph and Twitter sharing metadata
- Schema.org `WebSite` and `Place` structured data
- `robots.txt`
- `sitemap.xml`
- official Houston Intergroup and A.A. Meeting Guide links

### Google Search Console

1. Open Google Search Console and add the public site URL as a **URL-prefix property** (or add the whole domain as a Domain property if you control DNS).
2. If you choose HTML-tag verification, Google will provide a token. In `index.html`, uncomment the `google-site-verification` meta tag and replace `TOKEN` with the exact value Google provides.
3. Deploy the updated site and click **Verify** in Search Console.
4. Submit `https://clubalterations-ptx.org/sitemap.xml` in Search Console.
5. Use URL Inspection to request indexing of the home page after the first deployment.

If the site's real domain is not `clubalterations-ptx.org`, update every SEO URL before submitting the sitemap.

### Anonymity

Meeting chair/member names are intentionally not stored or rendered by this site. Keep public meeting listings limited to information such as group name, time, meeting format/type, and language.
